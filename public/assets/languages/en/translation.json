Our Corporate Values: Transparency: We provide transparent information to our customers, to the general public and to our employees. For example, we ensure that customers fully understand the terms of the contracts they conclude with us, and we engage in financial education in order to raise public awareness of the dangers of in transparent financial offer A culture of open communication: We are open, fair and constructive in our communication with each other, and deal with conflicts at work in a professional manner, working together to find solution Social responsibility and tolerance: We offer our clients sound, well founded advice. Before offering loans to our clients, we assess their economic and financial situation, their business potential and their repayment capacity. On this basis we help them to choose appropriate loan options from which they can genuinely benefit and to avoid becoming over indebted. Promoting a savings culture is another important part of our mission, as we believe that private savings play an especially crucial role in societies with relatively low levels of publicly funded social welfare provision. And we are committed to treating all customers and employees with fairness and respect, regardless of their origin, colour, language, gender or religious or political belief Service orientation: Every client is served in a friendly, competent and courteous manner. Our employees are committed to providing excellent service to all customers, regardless of their background or the size of their busines High professional standards: Our employees take personal responsibility for the quality of their work and always strive to grow as professional A high degree of personal integrity and commitment: Complete honesty is required of all employees in the ProCredit group at all times, and any breaches of this principle are dealt with swiftly and rigor ",
